# Macintosh-Garden-FTP-Search
Searches a cached version of the files on the Macintosh Garden FTP server and provides FTP links to download them.

Run the update.sh script to pull the latest inventory from Macintosh Garden. Honestly, I wouldn't run this very often to keep requests to the site to a minimum. Perhaps just update as needed.

Also hosted at http://mc68000.com/macintosh-garden-search/ (will not work with older browsers such as MacWeb or Mosaic since they do not send the "Host:" header which is needed by web servers using virtual hosts. A solution to this is to run this locally.
